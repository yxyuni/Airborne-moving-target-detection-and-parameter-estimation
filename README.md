# Multispectral Aerial Target Parameter Estimation

## Overview

This repository hosts the SHARP (Spectral and High-dynamic Aerial tARget with flight Parameters) Dataset and the ASPIRE (Aerial Spectral Parameter Intelligent Retrieval Estimator) framework, designed for multispectral aerial target parameter estimation. The project addresses the critical role of parameter estimation of aerial targets in applications such as air traffic control, disaster response monitoring, and security.

## Key Features

- **High-Resolution Imaging**: The dataset offers 2-meter ground resolution images with 512Ã—512 pixel dimensions.
- **Multispectral Imaging**: Leveraging data from GFDM (8 bands, 450nm-900nm) and CM-01 (4 bands, 450nm-890nm) satellites.
- **Parameter Estimation**: Estimates key parameters including velocity, direction, and altitude of aerial targets.

## Getting Started

To get started with the SHARP dataset and ASPIRE framework, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yxyuni/Airborne-moving-target-detection-and-parameter-estimation.git
